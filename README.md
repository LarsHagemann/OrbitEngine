# Orbit Game Engine
Orbit is a DirectX 12 based Game Engine (In future versions, OpenGL might be supported as well). 
Orbit is inspired by an early 2020 DirectX 11 engine, that has been developed by Treelab and now translated to DirectX 12.
Orbit supports easy environment creation, object manipulation and rendering. Orbit uses .orb files to read geometry and animation data, therefor,
a converter is currently in development (At the moment it only supports FBX files; See [Converter](https://github.com/LarsHagemann/OrbitEngine/converter)).
Orbit comes with several samples in the [Samples](https://github.com/LarsHagemann/OrbitEngine/samples) directory and its own wiki found on GitHub.
You can find anything you need to get started in the Wiki.

## STATUS: Unfinished.
Please come back later. This engine is far from being finished :).
